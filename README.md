# Robotics_NavStrategies
This project is part of the Robotics course from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The main goal of this project is to implement a navigation strategy so that the Pioneer-3DX robot is able to follow a reference trajectory, evaluating if there is any opened or semi-opened door. In order to control the robot tracjectory, we will be using the Laser Range Finder (LRF) to evaluate the distance between the robot and the wall.
